## 🚨 Quick Reference Red Flags Checklist

### 📋 Pre-Click Verification Checklist

Use this checklist before clicking any links or responding to suspicious communications:

#### **Email Header Analysis Checklist**

- [ ] **Sender Address Verification**
  - [ ] Domain matches expected organization
  - [ ] No misspellings in domain name
  - [ ] Email address format is professional
  - [ ] Reply-to address matches sender (if different, investigate)

- [ ] **Subject Line Analysis**
  - [ ] Content matches subject appropriately
  - [ ] No excessive urgency or threat language
  - [ ] No generic subject lines with personal requests
  - [ ] Grammar and spelling appear correct

- [ ] **Email Structure Review**
  - [ ] Professional greeting (your actual name, not "Dear User")
  - [ ] Company branding and logos appear authentic
  - [ ] Contact information matches organization records
  - [ ] No requests to bypass normal procedures

- [ ] **Link Analysis (Hover Test)**
  - [ ] Real destination matches displayed link text
  - [ ] Domain is legitimate (not suspicious variations)
  - [ ] Uses HTTPS (secure connection)
  - [ ] No shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

### 🔍 Detailed Link Analysis Tool

#### **URL Safety Assessment**

**Step 1: Extract and Analyze URL Components**
```
Example URL: https://secure-login.paypal.com.account-verification.net/login

Analysis:
├── Protocol: https (good)
├── Subdomain: secure-login (suspicious)
├── Main Domain: account-verification.net (not PayPal)
├── Path: /login (normal)
└── Final Assessment: MALICIOUS
```

**Step 2: Domain Reputation Check**
- Google Safe Browsing: `https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/`
- VirusTotal: `https://www.virustotal.com/`
- URLVoid: `https://www.urlvoid.com/`
- PhishTank: `https://phishtank.org/`

**Step 3: Red Flag Indicators**
🚨 **Immediate Red Flags:**
- IP addresses instead of domain names
- URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, goo.gl)
- Domains with numbers replacing letters (0=O, 1=L, etc.)
- Multiple subdomains or unusual domain structures
- Recently registered domains (check WHOIS data)

✅ **Legitimate Indicators:**
- Well-known, established domains
- Proper SSL certificates
- Consistent branding and design
- Professional contact information
- Clear privacy policies and terms

### 📊 Email Header Analysis Tool

#### **Suspicious Email Header Warning Signs**

**Sender Analysis:**
```
🚨 Red Flags:
├── Generic email services (gmail, yahoo, hotmail) for "business"
├── Domains with numbers/letters (micros0ft.com)
├── Recently registered domains
├── Typos in company names (amaz0n, paypa1)
└── Mismatched sender and display names

✅ Green Flags:
├── Professional corporate email domains
├── DMARC, SPF, DKIM authentication passes
├── Consistent branding and signatures
├── Professional language and formatting
└── Known contact information
```

**Routing Analysis:**
```
🚨 Red Flags:
├── Unusual sending IPs (foreign countries)
├── Multiple hop routing
├── Mismatched time zones
├── Failed authentication (SPF/DKIM fail)
└── Suspicious relay patterns

✅ Green Flags:
├── Internal company IPs
├── Expected geographic routing
├── Successful authentication
├── Standard corporate email patterns
└── Appropriate time stamps
```

## 🔧 Interactive Detection Tools

### 📧 Email Authentication Checker

#### **DMARC Policy Analysis**

```bash
# Check DMARC record for domain
dig TXT _dmarc.example.com

# Expected results:
# "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc-failures@example.com"
```

**DMARC Policy Levels:**
- `p=none` - No action (monitor only)
- `p=quarantine` - Send suspicious emails to spam
- `p=reject` - Reject suspicious emails entirely

#### **SPF Record Verification**

```bash
# Check SPF record
dig TXT example.com

# Expected legitimate SPF:
# "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:_spf.outlook.com ~all"
```

**SPF Mechanisms:**
- `include:` - Include external domain's SPF
- `ip4:` - Specific IP addresses allowed
- `a` - Domain's A records allowed
- `mx` - Domain's MX records allowed
- `all` - Policy for all others (+all, -all, ~all)

### 🌐 Website Security Validator

#### **SSL Certificate Analysis**

**Certificate Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Certificate is not expired
- [ ] Certificate matches the domain name
- [ ] Certificate is issued by trusted CA
- [ ] Certificate chain is valid
- [ ] No certificate warnings or errors

**Certificate Authority (CA) List:**
- Commercial CAs: DigiCert, GlobalSign, Symantec, Comodo
- Government CAs: NIST FIPS 140-2 compliant
- Extended Validation (EV) for high-security needs

#### **Website Security Headers Check**

**Essential Security Headers:**
```
🛡️ Required Security Headers
├── Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
├── X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
├── X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN
├── X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
└── Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
```

### 📱 Mobile Security Scanner

#### **QR Code Safety Analysis**

**QR Code Security Checklist:**
- [ ] Source is trusted (official business, known contact)
- [ ] Link destination appears legitimate
- [ ] No shortened or obfuscated URLs
- [ ] Verify on desktop before entering sensitive information
- [ ] Use QR scanner with security features

**Safe QR Code Practices:**
- Scan QR codes only from trusted sources
- Verify website legitimacy before entering information
- Use security-focused QR scanner apps
- Don't scan QR codes in public places for sensitive activities
- Be especially cautious in restaurants, parking, and public transport

## 🛡️ Prevention and Protection Tools

### 🔐 Password Security Toolkit

#### **Password Strength Checker**

```python
# Password Strength Assessment Tool
import re

def password_strength_checker(password):
    score = 0
    
    # Length check
    if len(password) >= 12:
        score += 2
    elif len(password) >= 8:
        score += 1
    
    # Character variety
    if re.search(r'[a-z]', password):
        score += 1
    if re.search(r'[A-Z]', password):
        score += 1
    if re.search(r'[0-9]', password):
        score += 1
    if re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password):
        score += 1
    
    # Penalties
    if re.search(r'(.)\1{2,}', password):  # Repeated characters
        score -= 1
    if password.lower() in ['password', '123456', 'qwerty', 'admin']:
        score = 0
    
    return max(0, min(score, 6))

# Usage
password = "MyStr0ng!P@ssw0rd"
strength = password_strength_checker(password)
print(f"Password Strength: {strength}/6")
```

**Password Recommendations:**
- Minimum 12 characters for critical accounts
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No dictionary words or personal information
- Unique passwords for each account
- Use password managers for complexity

#### **Multi-Factor Authentication Setup Guide**

├── 2. Register key with important accounts
├── 3. Configure backup authentication methods
├── 4. Test authentication before relying on it
├── 5. Keep backup keys in secure location
└── 6. Update emergency contacts and recovery options
```

**Software-Based MFA (Good Security):**
```
📱 Software MFA Setup
├── 1. Install authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)
├── 2. Enable MFA on all important accounts
├── 3. Store backup codes in secure location
